        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> The first time I ever tried Honey glazed Salmon, I was blown away by the flavors. Normally, I wasn't a huge fan of salmon, but as soon as I took just one bite of this flavorful tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.  </p>
        <p> Salmon is  a great source of healthy fats, protein, and vitamins and minerals. Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids which has been shown to help reduce inflammation, reduce risk of cardiovasular disease, and lower blood pressure. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and cajun seasonings. Set aside. Set your air fryer to 375 degrees for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and oil to a large skillet, over med-high heat <em>(or you can microwave until the butter melts).</em> Once the butter is melted, add the garlic, coconut aminos, honey, lemon juice, sriracha and cornstarch and mix the ingredients together. </li>
            <li>Place salmon, skin side down on aluminum foil in the air fryer, and pour your sauce mixture over the salmon and into the aluminum foil. About half way through take the salmon out and baste the sauce by spooking it over the top of the salmon. Place the salmon back in the airfryer and cook for 5 more minutes until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness. </li>
